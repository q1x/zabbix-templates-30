# zabbix-templates-30
This repository contains my efforts to create a repository based on the templates that we're shipped with Zabbix 3.0.
My goals with this repo are as follows:

- Create a logical and hierarchial structure in template linking
- Make templates as flexible as currently possible by utilizing LLD, (context aware) user macros and calculated items wherever possible
- Set up a naming convention so working with templates from automated API scripts becomes easier
- Utilize the description fields for templates, items and triggers to document behaviour as much as possible.
- Graph ALL the things, visualizing gathered data is key
